                        Scalable Space Time Info System

The long term goals of the stixar project:

- Maps with located news events.
- Linked Maps (parking lots, malls, building directories).
- Client Server with smooth client navigation.
- Tracking.
- Satellite and areal imaging.
- overlaid 3d geometry.
  * Elevation
  * buildings
- Searchable resources and layers.


Plan:

1)  geometry toolkit 2d
    - road networks, boundaries and areas.
    - overlay algorithms with boolean combinations

2) Storage of tiger geom data in form above.

3) viewing this data in client-server -> smooth multiresolution.

4) secondary text indices for objects in tiger road & gazeteer.

5) 

Current Status: need good graph library first,
working on that.  TBD: planarity check, topo edit undoable/redoable log,
minimun rank assignment, planar embedding interface, mincost flow,
matchings, min mean cycle,
